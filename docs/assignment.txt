CS456/CS556 Cryptography Assignment 3 (Fall 2013)
1. Submit this plaintext by email along with the ElGamal keys used to encrypt this plaintext.
2. Write a simple socket-based chat program that uses ElGamal with DES or AES (your choice). 
   As usual, allow the user to specify the bit-length for the prime used in ElGamal and also
   the secret key for DES/AES. Implement a system that simply encrypts single ASCII characters. 
   Arrange for an online demonstration of your program. 
You may work in groups of at most three for this assignment.
If you are enrolled in MA456 and prefer a non-programming assignment, let me know.
